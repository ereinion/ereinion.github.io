While attempting to get a Cassandra Socket IO program up and running, I came
across a strange issue.
The version of Cassandra that we were installing was using Cython. When doing

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo pip install cassandra-driver
{% endhighlight %}

errors were being generated relating to these Cython files. After scouring the 
internet I found a way around the issue using

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo pip install six futures
sudo pip install --install-option="--no-cython" cassandra-driver
{% endhighlight %}

This finally got my cassandra drivers to install properly for usage in python.
The only downside is that it wiped out my cassandra keyspaces from having to do
a clean install.
